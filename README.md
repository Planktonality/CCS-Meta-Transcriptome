## Introduction - Diatoms exhibit proactive transcriptomic response to the Upwelling Conveyor Belt Cycle (UCBC)

Phytoplankton in the California Current System (CCS) are important drivers of biogeochemical cycling and food web dynamics leading up to fish stocks and marine mammals - important aspects of the ecosystem and economy. A unique feature of the CCS is the concept of the Upwelling Conveyor Belt Cycle, which is characterized by a series of idealized zones directly related to the respective light conditions, nutrient status, and biology. Diatoms - a silicifying taxa of the CCS phytoplankton assemblage - are known to dominante the upwelling blooms in this region due to their physiological capabilities. However, our understanding of the molecular shifts within the major phytoplankton groups remain largely understudied. This study aims to address the bioinformatic tools used to assess the transcriptomic and metatranscriptomic activity of marine microalgae in response to the UCBC.
